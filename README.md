# AICTE-TECHSAKSHAM-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION
**Project Title:** Image Classification Using CNN and Pre-trained MobileNet Model with Streamlit Integration  

**Overview:**  
This project involves the implementation of an image classification pipeline using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the pre-trained MobileNet model. A user-friendly web application is created using Streamlit, allowing users to upload images for classification.  

**Key Features:**  
1. **Custom CNN Model:** Developed a custom CNN architecture for image classification tasks.  
2. **Pre-trained MobileNet Model:** Leveraged MobileNet, a lightweight and efficient model, fine-tuned for specific image classification needs.  
3. **Streamlit App Integration:** Built an interactive web interface using Streamlit for easy image uploads and real-time predictions.  
4. **Model Training and Deployment:** Trained models on labeled datasets, evaluated their performance, and deployed them in the Streamlit app.  
5. **Use Cases:** The system can be applied to domains like object recognition, medical image classification, and more.  

**Technology Stack:**  
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch (optional)  
- **Pre-trained Model:** MobileNet  
- **Web App Framework:** Streamlit  
- **Programming Language:** Python
